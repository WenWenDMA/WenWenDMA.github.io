    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
      <p>To make this abstract video, I started this project with shooting different movements of white candy beans while I move them on a piece of white of paper. The movements are beautiful and they inspired me to expand more meaning and keep its simplicity. I edited this video by using many different effect controls, especially focusing on adjusting the lights and shadows, slowing down or faster the speed and rotations,       </p>
