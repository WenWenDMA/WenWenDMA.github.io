    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
      <p>To make this abstract video, I started this project with shooting different movements of white candy beans while I moved them on a piece of white of paper. The movements are beautiful and they inspired me to expand more meanings about it as keeping its simplicity at the same time. I edited this video by using many different effect controls, especially focusing on adjusting the lights and shadows, slowing down or faster the speed and rotations, controlling the changes of time and the rhythm of movements. As the first time experience of using Adobe Premiere, I learned many techniques when I experimented different methods to achieve the image that I wanted to see.        </p>
