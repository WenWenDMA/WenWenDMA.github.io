    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
      <p>To make this abstract video, I started this project with shooting different movements of white candy beans while I moved them on a piece of white paper. The movements are beautiful and they inspired me to expand more meanings about it as keeping its simplicity at the same time. I edited this video by using many different effect controls, especially focusing on adjusting the lights and shadows, slowing down or faster the speed and rotations, controlling the changes of time and the rhythm of movements. As the first time experience of using Adobe Premiere, I learned many techniques when I experimented different methods to achieve getting the effects that I wanted to see. When watching this short video, you can hear discontinuity of different sounds, which seem like a soundwave from another space. The whole piece will show viewers a motion of mystery, an abstract presentation of nomal things and sounds that actually happens in peoople's everyday life.    </p>
